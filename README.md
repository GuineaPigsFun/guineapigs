## Introduction

Guinea Pigs is here to put NFT assets in every pocket as easily as memecoins.

NFTs are in their dip nowadays, although the reasons vary, we can still identify some key points.

First, people are focusing on memecoins, so other assets, including NFTs, are being drained.

Second, the lack of liquidity in NFTs has pushed traders away as it's hard to sell quickly, which is a disaster for crypto traders given the high volatility of the crypto market. It's crucial for crypto traders to be easy-in and easy-out. On the other hand, as art collections, the current quantity of NFT collections has far exceeded the market's capacity.

Our platform reinvents NFT creation, making it seamless for creators to launch their collections in just a few clicks. We streamline the entire process, offering an innovative NFT system with enhanced liquidity that democratizes the space for artists and collectors alike. By simplifying the creation process and introducing a new dimension of NFT ownership, our platform empowers creators to engage their communities like never before.

Guinea Pigs is a collection that will showcase how this works, and then we will launch our NFT platform where everyone can launch their NFT collection and pump it as easily as you do memecoins on Pump.fun.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
